# About me
I am **Dailing Zhang <font face="Ê•∑‰Ωì">(Âº†Â≤±Âáå)</font>**, an incoming Ph.D. student at **<a href="http://english.ia.cas.cn">Institute of Automation, Chinese Academy of Sciences (CASIA)</a >**, supervised by **<a href="https://people.ucas.ac.cn/~huangkaiqi?language=en">Prof. Kaiqi Huang</a >** (IAPR Fellow). Additionally, I am a member of **<a href="http://viig.aitestunion.com/">Visual Intelligence Interest Group (VIIG)</a >**.

Obtained a Bachelor's degree in **<a href="https://automation.seu.edu.cn/2019/0527/c24498a275140/page.htm">Robotics Engineering</a >** in **<a href="https://automation.seu.edu.cn/main.htm#">the School of Automation</a >**, **<a href="https://www.seu.edu.cn/english/main.htm">Southeast University</a >** in 2023.

Currently, my research focuses on visual object tracking, with a particular emphasis on the visual-language tracking task and combined with cognitive science. If you are intrigued by my work or wish to collaborate, feel free to reach out to me.
